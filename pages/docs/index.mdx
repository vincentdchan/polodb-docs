# Introduction

PoloDB is a library written in Rust
that implements a lightweight [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

# Why

PoloDB aims to offer a modern alternative to SQLite, which is currently the almost exclusive option for client-side data storage.
Although SQLite is an old and stable software, it lacks some modern features.
That's why we developed PoloDB, which is NoSQL, supports multi-threading and multi-sessions,
and retains the embedded and lightweight features of SQLite.

# Features

- Simple and Lightweight
- Easy to learn and use
  - NoSQL
  - MongoDB-like API
- Cross-Platform
- Multiple backends
  - Filesystem(WAL)
  - Memory
  - IndexedDB(WIP)

# Platform

Theoretically, PoloDB supports all platforms that the Rust compiler
supports.
But PoloDB is a personal project currently.
Limited by my time, I have only compiled and tested on the following platforms:

- macOS Big Sur x64
- Linux x64 (Tested on Fedora 32)
- Windows 10 x64
